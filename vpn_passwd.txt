VPN (IPSec) Prompting For Saved PasswordSymptoms:

     * On Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.x) you are prompted to enter your VPN
       password even though you've previously saved it in the keychain
     * You are using IPSec on the built in VPN client on Mac OS X Snow
       Leopard

       two items called VPN(IPSec)
    5. Double-click the VPN(IPSec) whos kind is IPSec XAuth Password
    6. Click the Access Control button/tab.  The applications permitted to
       use this keychain item will be displayed below.  If you're prompted
       for your password, enter it.
    7. Click the plus (+) sign
    8. When the Finder window appears, press Cmd + Shift + G on your keyboard
    9. When the Go To Folder dialog appears, enter /usr/libexec
